===================

nanobind to connect c++ to python 

TO DO
====
 - in miniconda python still need to install python version of bmc (we installed c++ version and RTC class initializes DM). Now need to install FLi SDK for both python and c++ in this python environment.
 - simulate a matrix multiplication to get a float DM command with basic error checking and send to the DM.

-----
to go back to old python version. go to home directory->menu->show hidden files-> bashrc -> comment out last line "export PATH=/home/baldr/miniconda3/bin:$PATH"

if making changes to rtc recompile 
baldr@baldr-Precision-T1600:~/Documents/rtc-example$ pip install --no-build-isolation -e .

to run in python 
baldr@baldr-Precision-T1600:~/Documents/rtc-example$ ipython


main python code in example.py, main cpp code in rtc.cpp


import rtc
r = rtc.RTC()

can make shared variable in c++ by initializing it in RTC class . 
e.g. 
struct RTC {

    DM hdm = {};

    float value = 10;

    etc etc

then in python

In [3]: r.value
Out[3]: 10.0

After adding in to CMake.txt file 

target_link_directories(_rtc PRIVATE "/opt/FirstLightImaging/FliSdk/lib/release")

target_include_directories(_rtc PRIVATE "/opt/FirstLightImaging/FliSdk/include")

and adding in code to RTC module to open FLI camera. It compiles but when importing rtc  in pytho it complains 

ImportError: /home/baldr/miniconda3/lib/python3.12/site-packages/rtc/_rtc.cpython-312-x86_64-linux-gnu.so: undefined symbol: _ZN6FliSdkC1Ev

addign in CMake.txt target_link_libraries(_rtc PRIVATE FliSdk) gets rid of this but then complains that it doesnt have access

ImportError: libFliSdk.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

copying line from CMake in example code we use
target_link_libraries(Example FliSdk)

Cannot specify link libraries for target "Example" which is not built by
        this project.

In the end copied to libFliSdk.so /lib
import rtc
ImportError: libboost_filesystem.so.1.73.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
deleted it from here after
